German Translation for FO4 LooksMenu 1.6.20

Nothing special, nothing else.
Just a text file, nothing more, really!

> Delete that god damn Readme.md before use unless you want your data folder to look like a trash can.

I don't even know why I save the file on github, it's also on Nexusmods, because... oh well, as a backup!
Happens from time to time that once again a crap HDD of the raid on which my projects are stored self-destructs, 
well I admit it, data on a raid 0 to store is really a stupid idea and HDD's are also still from the digital stone age.
I have SSD's lying here, but these are not installed because I'm just too lazy for it.
Let's look at the calendar when I have the next time time, even if that is not worth it with the old junk box.
Hmm... alternatives there are of course, for example to use my new PC which is right next to the old, but you know...
too lazy to plug all the plugs from the old into the new PC...
Now you're probably wondering why I'm writing all this crap that's even longer than the content of the actual file, right?
I have no clue, but I think this phenomenon is known to experts under the name of boredom.

Now but time fun aside, a little humor you can always use, especially in this day and age and I hope I could at least amuse you a little.
